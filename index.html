      <h2>the man martin luther king</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>On January 15, 1929, Martin Luther King Jr. is born in Atlanta, Georgia,
         the son of a Baptist minister. King received a doctorate degree in theology and
         in 1955 helped organize the first major protest of the African American civil rights
          movement: the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott.</li>
     <li>Influenced by Mohandas Gandhi, he advocated civil disobedience and
           nonviolent resistance to segregation in the South. The peaceful protests he led
            throughout the American South were often met with violence,
          but King and his followers persisted, and the movement gained momentum</li>
     <li>In 1964, the civil rights movement achieved two of its greatest successes:
            the ratification of the 24th Amendment, which abolished the poll tax,
             and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited racial discrimination in employment and
              education and outlawed racial segregation in public facilities.</li>
      <li>Later that year, King became the youngest person to win the Nobel
            Peace Prize (in 2014 Malala Yousafzai became the youngest to receive the prize at age 17).</li>
      <li>In the late 1960s, King openly criticized U.S. involvement in Vietnam and
            turned his efforts to winning economic rights for poor Americans.
             He was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968</li>
